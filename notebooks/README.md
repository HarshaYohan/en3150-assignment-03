# `notebooks/` — where every experiment runs

One notebook per assignment section. They are the **official drivers**: every number and figure in
the report comes from one of them, run in `MODE = "official"`. The code they call lives in the
shared library, `src/edgecnn/`. How the two fit together, and your day-to-day workflow, is in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md` §2–§3](../CONTRIBUTING.md#2-how-development-happens).

## The eight notebooks

| Notebook | Owner | § | Trains | Writes (official mode only) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`00_setup`](00_setup.ipynb) | M1 | — | — | nothing — environment, device, configs, contract tests |
| [`01_data_preparation`](01_data_preparation.ipynb) | M1 | 1 | — | `data/splits/*`, `results/figures/dataset/*` |
| [`02_custom_architectures`](02_custom_architectures.ipynb) | M2 | 2 | — | `results/tables/custom_architectures.md`, `param_breakdown.md` |
| [`03_optimizer_study`](03_optimizer_study.ipynb) | M3 | 3 | `model_b` × SGD, SGD+momentum, Adam | 3 × history + test metrics, curves, optimizer overlay |
| [`04_custom_training_evaluation`](04_custom_training_evaluation.ipynb) | M3 | 4 | `model_a` | history + test metrics, curves, confusion matrix |
| [`05_pretrained_finetuning`](05_pretrained_finetuning.ipynb) | M4 | 5 | `mobilenet_v2`, `squeezenet1_1` | 2 × history + test metrics, curves, confusion matrices |
| [`06_resource_benchmark`](06_resource_benchmark.ipynb) | M1 | 4, 6 | — | `resources.json` for all six runs |
| [`07_final_comparison`](07_final_comparison.ipynb) | M4 | 3, 4, 6 | — | all comparison tables, trade-off figures, `report/figures/` |

Notebooks never share variables. They communicate only through committed files — the five seams in
the [root README](../README.md#the-five-seams). So each notebook runs on its own, in any session, on
any machine.

**Official run order:** `01` → `02` → `03` → `04` → `05` → `06` → `07`. `04` reads Model B's run from
`03`; `06` needs every run's `history.json`; `07` needs everything.

## Inside every notebook

| Cell | What it does |
|---|---|
| Title | section, marks, owner, what it reads and writes, what the report needs from it |
| **1 · Colab bootstrap** | does nothing locally; on Colab it clones your fork (from your Colab Secrets), installs it, and fetches your latest push on every re-run |
| **2 · Setup** | `%autoreload 2`, imports, and **`MODE`** |
| Style | `apply_style()`: small inline figures, print-quality saved PNGs |
| Config | `cfg = load_config("configs/experiments/<run>.yaml", mode=MODE)` |
| Steps | markdown saying what the step does and what to check, then one library call, then one cell that shows its result |
| Checklist | the official-run checklist |
| Last | Colab only, official only: pushes this run's results |

The steps call **library functions**, never logic written inside the notebook. Until a function is
implemented, its cell raises `NotImplementedError` naming the member who owns it — that is expected.

## `MODE`

Set in cell 2. It changes how much runs and whether anything is written:

| `MODE` | Data | Epochs | Writes files? | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `"synthetic"` | generated fixture | 2 | no | before EuroSAT exists — seconds |
| `"debug"` | 5% of EuroSAT | 2 | no | finding bugs step by step |
| `"official"` | full EuroSAT | 30 | **yes** | the report |

Library functions return their results in every mode, so every plot still shows in a debug run. They
write only when `cfg.is_official`, so a debug run can never overwrite a committed result. For the real
run: set `MODE = "official"`, then Kernel → **Restart & Run All**.

## Opening a notebook in VS Code

Open the notebook, then **Select Kernel** (top right) → **Python Environments** → `.venv`. Imports
work because the package is installed in editable mode. **Never add `sys.path.append(...)`** —
`tests/test_notebooks.py` fails if you do.

## Autoreload

Cell 2 runs `%autoreload 2`, so edits to `src/edgecnn/**/*.py` apply the next time you run a cell.
Two caveats:

- **Objects built before the edit keep the old code.** Re-run the cell that *builds* the model, loader
  or trainer.
- **Some edits cannot be reloaded**, for example changing a dataclass's fields. If behaviour looks
  stale, restart the kernel.

## Outputs are committed

Every notebook is committed **with its outputs**, so plots and metrics are visible on GitHub without
running anything. Each notebook has a single owner, so this causes no merge conflicts. Keep them
small and clean:

- inline figures at ~100 DPI — the high-resolution PNG goes to `results/figures/`;
- no bulk prints: no whole DataFrames, no per-batch logs;
- repo-relative paths only — never `C:\Users\<you>\...`;
- **never** a token, password or email address in any cell or output.

## Running without the editor

```powershell
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace notebooks/03_optimizer_study.ipynb
```

Runs the notebook headless from a terminal and saves its outputs into the file, just like
Restart & Run All. Useful for leaving a long official run going.

## Colab

Everything runs locally by default. When a run is too slow on your laptop, run the **same notebook**
on Colab's GPU. Cell 1 fetches the code from your fork: in the browser it reads your fork and branch
from your Colab Secrets (`A03_REPO` / `A03_BRANCH`), so you never edit the notebook. In VS Code, which
cannot read Secrets, you edit cell 1's defaults for the session and put them back before committing.

- **Development (`synthetic` / `debug`):** VS Code with the Google Colab extension. The notebook stays
  on your laptop; only the kernel moves.
- **Official runs:** Colab in the browser. The last cell pushes the results, and
  *File → Save a copy in GitHub* brings the outputs back.

Step-by-step setup, what can run where, and troubleshooting: **[COLAB.md](../COLAB.md)**.

## `scratch/`

Personal notebooks for trying things out — see [`scratch/README.md`](scratch/README.md). Nothing in
`scratch/` ever produces a report result.
