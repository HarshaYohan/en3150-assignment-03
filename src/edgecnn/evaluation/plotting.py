"""Shared figure style, so every figure in the report looks like it belongs to one report.

Figures are drawn at two resolutions on purpose. Inline figures are stored
inside the notebooks, so they render at ``INLINE_DPI`` to keep the notebooks
small; the PNG files used in the report are saved at ``FIGURE_DPI``.

Team notes:
Owner: Member 1. Only style and generic helpers live here - the figures
themselves belong to curves.py (Member 3) and reporting.py (Member 4).
